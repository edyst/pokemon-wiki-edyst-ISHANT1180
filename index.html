The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In<br> the process of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found they <br>were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan <br> won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and<br> December.

 <h2>Q and A</h2>
 
 Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer<br>

•
We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well Basic knowledge of Pikachu essential for every trainer, but<br> you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain, Pikachu hly as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of <br>generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers<br> should be able to answer.

</p>
•
Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're<br> looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emargo in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game,<br> you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button<br> mashing at all is required

Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same<br> as those in the main Pokémon games, but<br> the effect of those type matchups is slightly<br> different in brief, things like effective or<br> resisted attacks have slightly different<br> multipliers to the main Pokémon games -<br> although a December 2018 update brought<br> them slightly closer in line.</td>
